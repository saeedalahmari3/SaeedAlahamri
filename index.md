### Saeed S. Alahmari

I'm a computer vision researcher working in application of (deep) machine learning in medical images.  I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/) under the directions of [Prof. Dmitry Goldgof](https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/people/goldgof-dmitry.aspx) and [Prof. Lawerence Hall](https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/people/hall-lawrence.aspx). 

### Research Interests:
I'm excited about using image analysis, computer vision and deep/machine learning to understand create predictive models of some diseases such as cancer. I have fouced on a varity of problems including cell counting, unbiased stereology, radiomics, COVID19 detection from CXR images. Moreover, I have interest in deep learning reproducibility and building self-supervised techniques, active learning to avoid large labeling of data.
